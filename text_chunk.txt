Generally
speaking,
Artificial
Intelligence
is
a
computing
concept
that
helps
a 
machine
think
and
solve
complex
problems
as
we
humans
do
with
our
intelligence. 
For
example,
we
perform
a
task,
make
mistakes
and
learn
from
our
mistakes
(At 
least
the
wise
ones
of
us
do!).
Likewise,
an
AI
or
Artificial
Intelligence
is
supposed 
to
work
on
a
problem,
make
some
mistakes
in
solving
the
problem
and
learn
from 
the
problems
in
a
self-correcting
manner
as
a
part
of
its
self-improvement.
Or
in 
other
words,
think
of
this
like
playing
a
game
of
chess.
Every
bad
move
you
make 
reduces
your
chances
of
winning
the
game.
So,
every
time
you
lose
against
your 
friend,
you
try
remembering
the
moves
you
made
which
you
shouldn’t
have
and 
apply
that
knowledge
in

and
so
on.
Eventually,
you
get
better
and 
your
precision,
or
in
this
case
probability
of
winning
or
solving
a
problem
improves
by
a
noteworthy
extent.
AI
is
programmed
to
do
something
similar
to 
that!
Artificial Intelligence vs Traditional Robotics
Phot o by Possessed Phot ography on Unsplash
When
we
hear
the
word
“Robot”,
an
image
of
a
metal
box
with
creepy
eyes
and 
speaking
in
a
mechanical
voice
pops
into
our
head.
I
mean
that’s
what
we
have 
been
watching
in
television
for
years,
isn’t
it?
And
to
a
certain
degree
we
are
right. 
Traditional
robotics
has
been
perceived
by
pop
culture
as
an
arena
that
creates 
humanlike
machines
to
work
for
us
as
saviours
and
sometimes
as
super-villains 
bringing
in
a
cascade
of
tyranny
into
the
human
world.
However,

life

pop
culture
as
an

machines

work
for
us
as
saviours
and
sometimes
as
super-villains 
bringing
in
a
cascade
of
tyranny
into
the
human
world.
However,
real
life
robots 
aren’t
as
humanlike
as
we
want
them
to
be,
yet.
They
are
programmed
in
a
specific 
way to only execute tasks that it has been programmed
to perform.
Imagine
a
self-driving
car
that
has
been
designed
to
drive
you
on
its
own
according 
to
where
you
instruct
it
to
take
you.
Now
for
a
traditional
robot,
the
car
is
going
to 
go
through
the
exact
road
that
it
was
programmed
to
select
for
a
certain
destination 
by
its
creators,
possibly
without
the
knowledge
of
traffic
and
cause
accidents. 
However,
a
human
driver
would
have
chosen
the
shortest
path
or
check
which 
paths
have
the
least
traffic
today
and
would
be
the
most
convenient
path
for
that 
particular
destination.
That
is
the
exact
humanlike
creative
thinking
the
traditional 
robots
lack!
They
are
fixed
in
their
own
“not
so
smart”
way
and

and
would
be
the
most
convenient
path
for
that 
particular
destination.
That
is
the
exact
humanlike
creative
thinking
the
traditional 
robots
lack!
They
are
fixed
in
their
own
“not
so
smart”
way
and
are
largely 
dependent
on
the
program
they
are
built
on
and
the
instructions
that
they
are
being 
given.
If
a
certain
instruction
doesn’t
coincide
with
their
program,
the
robot
won’t 
even
be
able
to
run,
let
alone
going
the
extra
step
of
being
creative.
This
is
the 
limitation
of
traditional
robots
Artificial
Intelligence
is
being
developed
to 
overcome.
Unlike
the
conventional
“bips
and
bops”,
a
good
AI
will
simulate
the
complicated
and
intuitive
sense
of
thinking
and
problem-solving
abilities
of
the 
human mind.
A Brief History of AI
The
concept
of
Artificial
Intelligence
is
not
as
modern
as
we
think
it
is.
This
traces 
back
to
as
early
as
1950
when
Alan
Turing
invented
the
Turing
test.
Then
the
first 
chatbot
computer
program,
ELIZA,
was
created
in
the
1960s.

Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep
Learning
Imag e by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay 
Up
until
now
in
this
article
we
were
discussing
about
Artificial
Intelligence
as
a 
process
that
is
going
to
help
machines
achieve
a
humanlike
mental
behaviour.
AI
is 
a
vast
and
growing
field
which
also
includes
a
lot
more
subfields
like
machine 
learning
and
deep
learning
and
so
on.
Machine
learning
is
in
a
nutshell
the
concept 
of
computers
learning
to
improve
their
predictions
and
creativity
to
resemble
a 
humanlike
thinking

like
machine 
learning
and
deep
learning
and
so
on.
Machine
learning
is
in
a
nutshell
the
concept 
of
computers
learning
to
improve
their
predictions
and
creativity
to
resemble
a 
humanlike
thinking
process
using
algorithms.
Machine
learning
involves
a
number 
of learning processes such as:
Supervised
learning
:
Supervised
learning
is
a
process
where
our
machines 
are
designed
to
learn
with
the
feeding
of
labelled
data.
In
this
process
our
machine
is
being
trained
by
giving
it
access
to
a
huge
amount
of
data
and
training
the 
machine
to
analyze
it.
For
instance,
the
machine
is
given
a
number
of
images
of 
dogs
taken
from
many
different
angles
with
colour
variations,
breeds
and
many 
more
diversity.
So
that,
the
machine
learns
to
analyze
data
from
these
diverse 
images
of
dogs
and
the
“insight”
of
machines
keep
increasing
and
soon
the 
machine
can
predict
if
it’s
a
dog
from
a
whole
different
picture
which
was
not
even 
a part of the labelled data set of dog images the

dogs
and
the
“insight”
of
machines
keep
increasing
and
soon
the 
machine
can
predict
if
it’s
a
dog
from
a
whole
different
picture
which
was
not
even 
a part of the labelled data set of dog images the
machine was fed earlier.
Unsupervised
learning
:
Contrary
to
the
supervised
learning,
the 
unsupervised
learning
algorithms
comprises
analyzing
unlabelled
data
i.e.,
in
this 
case
we
are
training
the
machine
to
analyze
and
learn
from
a
series
of
data,
the 
meaning
of
which
is
not
apparently
comprehendible
by
the
human
eyes.
The 
machine
looks
for
patterns
and
draws
conclusions
on
its
own
from
the
patterns
of 
the
data.
Important
thing
to
remember
that
the
dataset
used
in
this
instance
is
not 
labelled and the conclusions are drawn by the machines.
Reinforcement
learning
:
Reinforcement
learning
is
a
feedback
dependent 
machine
learning
model.
In
this
process
the
machine
is
given
a
data
and
made
to 
predict
what
the
data
was.
If
the
machine
generates
an
inaccurate
conclusion
about 
the

If
the
machine
generates
an
inaccurate
conclusion
about 
the
input
data,
the
machine
is
given
feedback
about
its
incorrectness.
For
example, 
if
you
give
the
machine
an
image
of
a
basketball
and
it
identifies
the
basketball
as
a 
tennis
ball
or
something
else,
you
give
a
negative
feedback
to
the
machine
and 
eventually
the
machine
learns
to
identify
an
image
of
a
basketball
on
its
own
when 
it comes across a completely different picture of
a basketball.

Deep
Learning,
on
the
other
hand
is
the
concept
of
computers
simulating
the 
process
a
human
brain
takes
to
analyze,
think
and
learn.
The
deep
learning
process 
involves
something
called
a
neural
network
as
a
part

AI at Work Today
Phot o by Dan Seif ert / The V erge
The
most
common
examples
of
uses
of
Artificial
Intelligence
can
be
found
today 
in
smart
personal
assistants
like
Apple’s
Siri
and
Amazon’s
Alexa.
People
interact 
with
these
devices
to
command
them
on
a
daily
basis
and
these
devices
use
the 
commands
as
a
part
of
their
dataset
to
learn
from.
Another
known
example
of 
Artificial
Intelligence
is
the
use
of
algorithms
in
Netflix.
Netflix
provides
very 
much
accurate
and
relevant
suggestions
of
movies,
tv
series
from
our
data
which
is 
created
every
time
we
stream
or
click
on
something
in
Netflix.
As
the
dataset
for 
these
systems
grows,
their
accuracy
and
precision
increase
as
well.

Many
banks
are 
using
AI
as
a
means
to
identify
unauthorized
credit
cards
uses.
From
analyzing 
complex
genetic
data
to
perform
the
most
delicate
surgeries
at
the
highest
precision 
is
also
being
worked
on
to
integrate
with
AI.
We
all
know
about
companies
like 
Tesla
and
Apple
working
to
make
flawless
self-driving
cars
which
is
going
to
have 
game changing impacts on the future of transportation.
Concerns about AI
One
of
the
most
immediate
concerns
about
Artificial
Intelligence
is
the
fear
of 
losing
jobs.
Artificial
Intelligence
enhancing
automation
is
also
causing
huge
job 
losses
around
the
world.
According
to
a
Forbes
article,
it
is
predicted
that
by
2025 
automation
will
cause
a
loss
of
85
million
jobs.

Automatization
of
weapons
is
also
a
big
reason
people
worry
about
the
future
of 
Artificial
Intelligence.
The
idea
that
weapons
can
be
used
to
search
and
target 
someone
with
pre-programmed
instructions
and
the
misuse
of
this
by
governments 
or
mafias
or
rogue
AI
can
be
something
very
deadly
and
devastating.
However, 
there
are
many
myths
in
disguise
of
concerns
surrounding
AI
that
spreads
panic 
and
misinformation.
AI
today
is
nowhere
near
to
become
a
super-intelligent
entity 
and
turn
into
our
overlords
like
in
sci-fi
movies.
However,
heavy

and 
cautions
are

advised
by

Artificial Intelligence and The Future
It
is
said
that
AI
is
the
greatest
thing
humankind
has
ever
worked
on.
AI
is
being 
used
in
image
and
speech
recognition
and
analysis
which
will
be
far
better
than 
human recognition of image and speech and its application
stretches wide and far. 
There
are
research
and
works
being
conducted
using
AI
that
is
going
to
play
a
very 
important
role
in
our
future
healthcare.
AI
is
being
worked
on
to
cure
Alzheimer’s 
disease
and
someday
even
blindness.
Someone

The
uses
of

work
is
being
done
to

AI
is
still
in
a
fairly
preliminary
(but
rapidly
growing)
stage
today
and
it
requires 
more
and
more
training
to
develop.

due
to
endless
AI
applications
in
agriculture,
education, 
transportation,
finance,

Towards Conclusion…
The
growth
of
Artificial

in
recent
times
has
been
exponential.
We 
cannot
even
imagine
how
big
and
impactful
AI
is
going
to
be
in
the
near
future
and 
how
drastically
it
is
going
to
change
and
upgrade
the
world
we
live
in
today.
There 
are
a
lot
more
to
learn
about
AI
and
its
rapidly
growing
applications
in
our
life.
I 
believe
it
would
be
wise
to
adapt
to
this
changing
world
and
acquire
skills
related 
to
Artificial
Intelligence
and
technology.
Just
like
AI
learns
and
develops,
we 
should too - to make this world a better place.References:
